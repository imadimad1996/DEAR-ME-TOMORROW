# Dear Me, Tomorrow — Game Design

## Core Loop
1. Spend energy to spawn chain items.
2. Drag and merge matching items to raise tier.
3. Complete orders for coins/energy/booster rewards.
4. Trigger Echo visual moments to create emotional peaks.
5. Read letters that deepen narrative tone and retention.

## MVP Playable Scope
- Fully playable Entrance Hall.
- Active chains: Wood + Culinary (8 tiers each).
- Data includes Ocean + Tech (disabled by config flag).
- Up to 5 active orders.
- Echo visual overlay only (single path, no branching).
- Scrap blockers on board.
- 3 boosters.

## Emotional Tone
- Warm, reflective, lightly funny.
- Micro-copy examples:
  - Merge fail: "Not soulmates yet."
  - Energy empty: "Coffee break? Your future self approves."
  - Order complete: "You did a tiny miracle."

## Roadmap Snapshot
- M1: Merge core + onboarding + first polish.
- M2: Live tuning, stronger narrative cadence, ad funnel optimization.
- M3+: expand rooms/chains/liveops.
