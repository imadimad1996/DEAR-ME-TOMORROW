# 60 Day Plan

## Week 1-2
- Merge loop + drag/drop + merge rules.
- Placeholder art integration.
- Baseline analytics events wired.
- Success metric: stable core loop, no blocker crashes.

## Week 3-4
- Orders + energy + 2 active chains.
- Scrap blockers + boosters.
- Early juice and feedback pass.
- Success metric: session flow playable end-to-end.

## Week 5
- Echo overlay + aura/ring/particles.
- Letters screen + 5 emotional/funny letters.
- Success metric: first emotional retention beats.

## Week 6
- Economy tuning pass.
- Sound layering pass.
- UI polish and modal flows.
- Success metric: cleaner pacing, fewer friction points.

## Week 7
- Internal testing.
- Friction fixes and merge clarity tweaks.
- Letter readability/length tuning.
- Success metric: reduced fail-dropoff moments.

## Week 8
- Closed beta (20-30 players).
- KPI review and balancing iteration.
- Targets:
  - D1 >= 40%
  - Average session >= 8 min
  - Time-to-first-merge <= 20s

## Cross-Week Risks
- Merge readability drops on low-contrast devices.
- Early economy too tight causing energy frustration.
- Narrative pacing mismatch (letters too long/too short).
- Cinematic effects causing frame drops on low-end phones.
